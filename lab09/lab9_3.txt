a.
    i. Full Size is 25000, it picks a subset of 2000 images.
    ii. This convnet has more layers than the one in class did, and goes through more convoluting than the one in class.
    iii. As it gets farther along it starts having moments where the entire image is black, This seems to be a sort of
         reset.

b. i. Data augmentation is artificially increasing the number of training images by performing random transformations to
      existing pictures.
