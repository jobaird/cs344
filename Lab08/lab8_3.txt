a. seaborn is more complex than matplotlib. It also gives access to plot types that matplotlib does not have, and makes
plots look better than matplotlib does.

b. The data set has something like 397 entries, I would consider anything over 200 entries to be more than appropriate,
as it gets hard to get data entries the more you ask for.

c. Prescribed normalization makes everything share a scale. This makes it easier to compare data in a graphical manner.

d. It is not a linear model, as relu is being used.

e. I agree, as if you had too large of a network, then you would end up with a network that just memorized the inputs
as opposed to actually learning from them.
