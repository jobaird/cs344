a. both of hill and simulated annealing seam to solve the problem. Both seem to do an equal job of solving the problem.

b.Both seem to get done in the same amount of time.

c.It does not make a difference, as the absolute maximum is the same regardless of x.

d.Changing the delta effects the accuracy of the searches. It does this because the delta effects the length of the
