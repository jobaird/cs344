3.1

A. AC3 is the only one that gets them done in a timely manner, but it is unable to discover the answer to the harder
problems. Backtracking is able to solve the easier problems in a timely manner, but not the harder ones. Dpeth first and
min conflicts are not able to solve them in a timely manner.

b.select_unassigned_variable=mrv and inference=forward_checking combined sped things up a lot.

3.2

a. It doesn't work at any n for AC. for backtracking, it finds it still at 25 or so, but starts hanging later. For min
conflicts, it is able to still find solutions decently fast at 2000 queens.

b.Min conflicts works the best. It works best because the whole point of the n queens problem is to find the minimum
amount of conflicts between pieces.

c.It takes 47 steps at 2000 queens.

3.3

a. For traditional problems, it only keeps track of the initial and goal states, while csp doesnt care about the goal
state, instead keeping track of domains, variables, constraints, and many others. The traditional search can only do
actions and tests on the current and goal state, while csp keeps track of the current state, and is able to act based on
changes in current state by actions that it is given.

b.The heuristics deployed in the traditional problem solving method is extremely simple, yet action based, meaning for
more complex problems, the traditional method proves to be pretty "dumb". The Constraint-based solution however, is much
more robust, keeping track of current states, neighbor variables, and the variables themselves, but they are both action
based systems, meaning they both need to be given specific inputs in order to work effectively.
