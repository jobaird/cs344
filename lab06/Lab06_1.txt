Ex 1.
    I would like the ML model to figure out if a email sent through Gmail is "important" or not.

Ex 2.
    The ideal outcome is that any email that us run through this system should be labelled, correctly, as important
    or not important depending on the contents of the email.

Ex 3.
    a. The model is successful if most all emails (n emails) run through it are correctly labeled important or not.
    b. The key results are the number of emails that are labeled correctly vs incorrectly.
    c. The model is a failure if a great number of emails is labeled incorrectly.

Ex 4.
    a. The output of the ML model is a list or set of important emails taken from the emails given.
    b. The output is defined as every email that is placed in the set should be defined as important by the ML system.

Ex 5.
    a. The ML output would hopefully be taken by further logic sent along to a system to sort those emails within
    an inbox.
    b. The outcome will be used for proper sorting of emails based on whether or not the email is deemed important.

Ex 6.
    If we did not use ML we would need to hardcode certain words or
    phrases in the subject line that would be easily identified as important or not important.

Ex 7.
    a. The problem is best framed as a Clustering solution, which predicts the importance of an email.
    b. Breakdown: Whether or not the email has IMPORTANT in the subject line or not.
