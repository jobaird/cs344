a. If time is important, and you do not want to worry about overfitting a model, then you would use a linear model
over a deep neural network model.

b. The deep Neural Network model does better than the linear on the training set.

c. Yes, embeddings help with sentiment analysis tasks by insuring that information is correctly conveyed through many
layers

d. Entertaining and enjoyed have similar embeddings, since they would be more likely to show up on a movie you liked.
