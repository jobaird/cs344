a. Categorical data is data relevant to a category or set of non numerical objects, while numeric data is relevant to
numerical objects.

b. Task 1: "train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00002,
    steps=600,
    batch_size=6
)" Final RMSE: 166.32

Task 2: "train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00002,
    steps=600,
    batch_size=6,
    input_feature="population"
)" Final RMSE: 184.57

c. The parameters learned in these exercises are the learning rate, steps taken, and batch size.
   There are no hard rules for an algorithm for standard tuning of these parameters.
