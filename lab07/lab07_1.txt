a. Exercise 1: "cities['Greater than 50 miles area and is named after a saint'] = (cities['Area square miles'] > 50) &
               cities['City name'].apply(lambda name: name.startswith('San'))"
               "cities"
   Exercise 2: "cities.reindex([5,34,99])"

pandas.

c.It might be useful to reorder a pandas data frame in order to look at the data in a new way and find out new info
based on that.
